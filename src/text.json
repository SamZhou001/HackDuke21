    "EASY": "Humans have extensively used the coastal zone for fishing, tourism, transport of goods, water treatment, and housing. Agriculture has benefited from the exceptionally fertile grounds due to marine deposits. Approximately three billion people, half the world’s population, live and work within a couple of hundred kilometers of a coastline, notwithstanding the vulnerability of coastal areas to flooding.",
    "MEDIUM": "To sit in solemn silence in a dull, dark dock, In a pestilential prison, with a life-long lock, Awaiting the sensation of a short, sharp shock, From a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block!",
    "HARD": "Shrewd Simon Short sewed shoes. Seventeen summers, speeding storms, spreading sunshine successively, saw Simon’s small, shabby shop, still standing staunch, saw Simon’s selfsame squeaking sign still swinging silently specifying: Simon Short, Smithfield’s sole surviving shoemaker. Shoes sewed soled super finely."
